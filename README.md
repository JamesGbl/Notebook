# Notebook
A modern notebook control built for performance that does not flicker for wxWidgets

**Why not creating a new art provider for wxAuiNotebook ?**

The reasons are varying from

 - The wxAui Art provider does not allow tabs to overlap, this limits the capabilities of tabs drawings
 - Buffered drawing is not always used, this causes flicker (mainly noticeable on Linux) when changing or closing tabs
 - No matter what, the active tab is awlays visible
 - Always display the maximum number of tabs that can fit into the tab control drawing area


The current implementation offers two built-in styles:

 - Dark Tabs 
 - Light Tabs

Here is how the current `Notebook` looks like:
